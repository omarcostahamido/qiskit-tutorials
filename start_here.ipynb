    "# Qiskit Tutorials\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome Qiskitters.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "These tutorials aim to explain how to use Qiskit. We assume you have installed Qiskit; if not, please look at [qiskit.org](http://www.qiskit.org) or the install [documentation](https://qiskit.org/documentation/install.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "The focus of these notebooks is not on learning quantum computing.  Instead we will focus on how to use Qiskit, and will go into details only when needed. For those interested in learning about quantum computing we recommend the [Qiskit Textbook](https://qiskit.org/textbook) that we and the community have put together, or the [Qiskit documentation](https://qiskit.org/documentation).\n",
    "\n",
    "Qiskit is made up of four elements: **Terra**, **Aer**, **Ignis**, and **Aqua**. Each element has its own focus, and together they make up the full Qiskit framework. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "## Terra Advanced\n",
    "\n",
    "Terra, the ‘earth’ element, is the foundation on which the rest of the software lies. Terra provides a bedrock for composing quantum programs at the level of circuits and pulses, to optimize them for the constraints of a particular device, and to manage the execution of batches of experiments on remote-access devices. Terra defines the interfaces for a desirable end-user experience, as well as the efficient handling of layers of optimization, pulse scheduling and backend communication.\n",

    "Aer, the ‘air’ element, permeates all Qiskit elements. To really speed up development of quantum computers, we need better simulators with the ability to model realistic noise processes that occur during computation on actual devices. Aer provides a high-performance simulator framework for studying quantum computing algorithms and applications in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum regime. \n",

    "\n",
    "##  Ignis\n",
    "\n",
    "Ignis, the ‘fire’ element, is dedicated to fighting noise and errors and to forging a new path. This includes better characterization of errors, improving gates, and computing in the presence of noise. Ignis is meant for those who want to design quantum error correction codes, or who wish to study ways to characterize errors through methods such as tomography and randomized benchmarking, or even to find a better way for using gates by exploring dynamical decoupling and optimal control.\n",
